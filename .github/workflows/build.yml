    steps:
      # Three attempts with a 60-second cooldown between each.
      # Transient failures (RPM Fusion mirror timeouts, registry blips) are
      # retried automatically.  Genuine build errors fail all three attempts
      # and surface the same exit-code as before.
      #
      # Uses repeated native steps rather than a wrapper action so that the
      # multiline cosign_private_key secret is handled by the Actions runner
      # (which masks secrets correctly) instead of being parsed as raw YAML.
